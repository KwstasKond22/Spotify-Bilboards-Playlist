Importing necessary libraries:

BeautifulSoup is imported from the bs4 library for parsing HTML.
requests is imported to send HTTP requests to fetch web page content.
User input for date:

input() prompts the user to enter a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
Fetching Billboard Hot 100 songs:

requests.get() is used to send an HTTP GET request to the Billboard Hot 100 chart page for the specified date.
The response's HTML content is stored in the response variable.
Extracting song names using BeautifulSoup:

response.text contains the HTML content of the web page.
BeautifulSoup() is used to create a BeautifulSoup object named soup by parsing the HTML content.
soup.select() is employed to find all the <h3> elements within certain list items (li ul li h3) on the page that typically contain the song names.
A list comprehension is used ([song.getText().strip() for song in song_names_spans]) to extract text content from each of these elements, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and storing them in the song_names list.
Displaying the extracted song names:

The print(song_names) statement outputs the list of extracted song names to the console.
This script essentially does the following:

Asks the user for a date in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
Fetches the Billboard Hot 100 chart for that date.
Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract song names from the chart.
Displays the extracted song names to the user.
